This repostory contains my copy of the "Ultimate Porfolio" series from [Hacking with Swift+](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus), which is a fantastic online learning resource developed and maintained by [Paul Hudson](https://www.twitter.com/twostraws).


It contains a SwiftUI based project managemenent app that uses `CoreData` and `CloudKit` for storing user data. This app intends to implement several Apple Frameworks to extend its functionality and ultimately deliver a universal App that works also on the Mac thanks to the power of SwiftUI.

## Pre-requisites

This iOS App is written using Xcode 13 and Swift 5.5. However, its been designed to include support for iOS 14 as well. Thus, this project can be compiled using Xcode 12+ and any iOS device with iOS 14 or later installed.

#### Requirements
* Xcode 12 or later.
* iOS device with iOS 14 or later (for testing features reliant on physical hardware such as VoiceOver or Haptics).
* Paid Apple Developer Program Account (for access to CloudKit Console and its functionalities.).

#### Optional
* Homebrew.
* Swiftlint.
* SwiftFormat for Xcode.

## What have I learned?
* App Prototyping and Design with SwiftUI.
* Decoding and Encoding data with JSON.
* Working with `CoreData` in SwiftUI.
* `CloudKit` usage with `NSPersistantCloudKitContainer`.
* Unit and UI Tests.
* Project Documentation.
* MVC and MVVM Architectural Patterns.
* Code Linting and Project Organization.
* Accessibility (VoiceOver and Dynamic Type).
* Several Xcode tips ans tricks.
* App Internationalization and Localization.
* `CoreHaptics` and Custom Haptics.
